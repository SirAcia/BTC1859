#' Question 1: Suppose 6 out of 15 students in a class develop influenza, 
#' whereas there is 20% chance for a student in similar school classes 
#' nationwide to develop influenza. Is there evidence of an excessive number 
#' of cases in the class? That is, what is the probability of obtaining at 
#' least 6 cases in this class if the nationwide rate holds true?
